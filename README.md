# Image Processing & Spritesheet Generator

A tool that processes images by removing backgrounds, compressing them, and combining them into spritesheets. Available both as a command-line tool and a web interface.

## Features

- üé® Automatic background removal
- üóúÔ∏è Configurable image compression
- üéØ Transparent pixel handling
- üì¶ Automatic spritesheet generation
- üåê Web interface with live preview
- üíæ Processing history tracking

## Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Install the required dependencies:
```
    pip install opencv-python-headless numpy rembg streamlit pillow tqdm
```

## Usage

### Web Interface

Run the web interface with:

```
    streamlit run app.py
```

Then:
1. Open your browser to the displayed URL
2. Upload your images
3. Adjust compression settings
4. Click "Process Images" to generate your spritesheet

### Command Line

Process images from the command line:

```
    python compress.py input_directory output_directory [-r RATIO] [-a]
```

Arguments:
- `input_directory`: Folder containing your source images
- `output_directory`: Where to save processed images
- `-r, --ratio`: Compression ratio (default: 8)
- `-a, --allow-transparent`: Enable transparent pixel handling

## Configuration

Key settings you can adjust:
- Compression ratio (2-16)
- Transparency handling
- Alpha threshold (50 by default)
- Visibility ratio (0.5 by default)

## Supported Formats

Input formats:
- PNG
- JPG/JPEG

Output format:
- PNG (with transparency support)

## How It Works

1. **Background Removal**: Uses the `rembg` library to remove image backgrounds
2. **Compression**: Reduces image size by combining pixel blocks using median values
3. **Spritesheet Generation**: Combines processed images horizontally into a single spritesheet

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- See `requirements.txt` for full dependency list
